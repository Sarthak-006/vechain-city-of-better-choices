## ⛓️ Blockchain Integration

### VeChain Message Signing

The game uses **gas-free message signing** for story verification:

```javascript
// Story verification without gas fees
async function saveStoryToBlockchain(storyData) {
    const message = JSON.stringify({
        app: 'CityOfBetterChoices',
        action: 'saveOutcome',
        data: storyData,
        timestamp: Date.now()
    });
    
    const signed = await vendor.sign('message', { message });
    return '0x' + btoa(signed.signature).slice(0, 10);
}
```

### What Gets Signed

- Story ending category and environmental score
- Impact metrics (CO2, plastic, water, energy)
- AI-generated image URLs
- Player's wallet signature
- Timestamp of completion

### Smart Contract (Optional)

- **File:** `ForestAdventure.sol`
- **Network:** VeChain Testnet
- **Status:** Available for permanent on-chain storage
- **Cost:** Requires test VET/VTHO for deployment
